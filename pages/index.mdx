# Hey!

INTRO My name is Antoni (*he/him*), I currently live in Warsaw, Poland and work as a full stack developer at [Omni Calculator](https://omnicalculator.com), a startup that provides hundreds of custom-built calculators, each of them solving a real-life problem. I'm also studying computer science at the [Military University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_University_of_Technology).

TECH While I've been interested in technology since kindergarten, my real programming journey started in 2016 when I started learning JavaScript. I'm entirely self-taught, learning only through open-source contributions, documentations, and blog posts. Nowadays, my main programming languages are TypeScript and JavaScript, but I also use C++ for my school assignments and sometimes tinker with Rust for WebAssembly.

OTHER I'm a big fan of the open-source community, and I maintain several projects on GitHub. I'm also an indie hacker -- in June 2020, I launched my first paid app on Product Hunt -- [Parsify Desktop](https://parsify.app), a cross-platform, text-based calculator. It is used by thousands of individuals worldwide, and I'm still developing it.

MEDIA If you like listening to tech podcasts, I appeared on the [85th episode](https://changelog.com/jsparty/85) of JS Party by [The Changelog](https://changelog.com). Fragment of a conversation between me, Feross Aboukhadijeh, and Mikeal Rogers, from the aforementioned episode, was mentioned in *Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*, a book by Nadia Eghbal, published by Stripe Press.

INTERESTS When it comes to offline activities, I hugely enjoy cycling and listening to classical music. Besides that, I love traveling! As of today, I've been to several countries, and I'm looking forward to visit more places in the future.

SOCIAL You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dokwadratu), [GitHub](https://github.com/xxczaki), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/akepinski). My email address is *antoni* at this domain. Last but not least, I also have a <NextLink href='/resume' passHref><Link text='resume'/></NextLink>.
