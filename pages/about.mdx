# About me

My name is Antoni (*he/him*), I'm 18 years old, born and raised in Poland. I currently live near Pozna≈Ñ and work remotely as a full stack developer at [Omni Calculator](https://omnicalculator.com), a Polish startup that provides hundreds of custom-built calculators, each of them solving a real-life problem. Previously, I've also worked at [myPolitics](https://mypolitics.eu).

While I've been interested in technology since kindergarten, my real programming journey started in 2016 when I started learning JavaScript. I'm entirely self-taught, learning only through open-source contributions, documentations, and blog posts. Nowadays, my main programming languages are TypeScript and JavaScript, but I also use C++ for my school assignments and sometimes tinker with Rust for WebAssembly.

I'm a big fan of open-source, and I maintain several exciting projects on GitHub. I'm also an indie hacker &mdash; in June 2020, I launched my first paid app on Product Hunt &mdash; [Parsify Desktop](https://parsify.app), a cross-platform, text-based calculator. It is used by individuals worldwide, and I'm constantly updating it with new features.

If you like listening to tech podcasts, I appeared on the [85th episode](https://changelog.com/jsparty/85) of JS Party by [The Changelog](https://changelog.com). Fragment of a conversation between me, Feross Aboukhadijeh, and Mikeal Rogers, from the aforementioned episode, was mentioned in *Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*, a book by Nadia Eghbal, published by Stripe Press.

When it comes to offline activities, I hugely enjoy riding a bike with my friends and listening to classical music. Besides that, I love traveling! As of today, I've been to several countries, and I'm looking forward to going to more places in the future.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dokwadratu), [GitHub](https://github.com/xxczaki), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/akepinski) and [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/xxczaki). If you are looking for my resume, you can find it [here](https://kepinski.ch/resume.pdf).
