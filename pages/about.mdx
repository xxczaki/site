# About me

My name is Antoni (*he/him*), I'm 18 years old and I was born and raised in Poland. I currently live near Pozna≈Ñ and work remotely as a full stack engineer at [myPolitics](https://mypolitics.eu), a start-up educating people of all ages about politics by providing a fully-featured platform with interviews, news articles and political views tests.

While I've been interested in technology since the kindergarten, my real programming journey started in 2016 when I started learning JavaScript. I'm fully self-taught, meaning I learn only through open-source contributions, documentations and blog posts.

Nowadays, my main programming languages are TypeScript and JavaScript, but I also use C++ for my school assignments and sometimes tinker with Rust for WebAssembly.

I'm a big fan of open-source and I maintain several interesting projects on GitHub. I'm also an indie hacker &mdash; in June 2020 I launched my first paid app on Product Hunt &mdash; [Parsify Desktop](https://parsify.app), a cross-platform, text-based calculator. It is used by individuals around the world and I'm constantly updating it with new features.

When it comes to offline activities, I hugely enjoy riding a bike with my friends and listening to classical music. Besides that, I love travelling! As of today, I've been to several countries and I'm looking forward to going to more places in the future.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dokwadratu), [GitHub](https://github.com/xxczaki), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/akepinski) and [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/xxczaki).
