# On Allegro.EU SA stock situation

> Published December 19, 2021 by [Antoni Kępiński](/about).

[Allegro](https://allegro.pl) is a Polish online auction platform founded in 1999. It is currently owned by an alliance of investor funds: Cinven, Permira, and Mid Europa Partners. In October 2020, the company raised $2.3 billion during its IPO - the largest ever on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW). The opening price per share was PLN 36.79, which soon skyrocketed to over PLN 80. However, since September 2021, the price has dropped to less than PLN 38 (*see the chart below*). That led many investors to wonder whether it's worth investing in the largest shopping platform in Poland.

Let's do some market analysis.

## Amazon comes to Poland

In March 2021, Amazon, the largest global e-commerce platform, officially launched its site in Poland[^1]. Before that, people could shop using Amazon.de, which often came with high shipping costs. The announcement did not scare the investors much - the price per Allegro share was above PLN 60 and did not fall below PLN 50 until mid-October.

Notwithstanding, the ~~launch~~ rise of Amazon.pl may have been what made many investors sell their shares of Allegro; they knew initially that the selection of products offered by Amazon would likely be much worse than Allegro's since the latter was available years earlier in the country and, ergo, gained the reputation as a trustworthy Polish firm, they probably underestimated how fast Amazon could attract customers. The overall selection of products improved, but Amazon also began selling its Prime subscription with a meager price of PLN 49 per year (roughly \$12 - more than \$100 less than in the U.S.!). All of this ultimately led to Allegro's stock price drop and flattening its financial results[^2].

## COVID-19 pandemic

Until June 2021, there were many COVID-related restrictions in use in Poland. One could think that such a situation may have been a sales booster, as people couldn't / were scared about shopping outside. Many virologists and government officials recommended using online e-commerce platforms with non-contact delivery options[^3]. Unfortunately, the pandemic job losses and financial stability crisis of many industries dominated. Because of that, the price of Allegro's share dropped from PLN 80 in January to PLN 51 in May. Since the restrictions during the summer were not strict, many people were able to travel abroad and enjoy dining outside. The charts reflect that; in July 2021, the price rose to more than PLN 70. There was a slight drop (about PLN 10) in August that later recovered - I'm not sure what could have caused it.

As mentioned in the introduction, Allegro's stock price began falling in September. The number of cases started to rise, reaching almost 30k in November[^4]. Looking back at the chart from before the vacations, we see the exact price fall.

## Inflation

As we know, this metric affects all branches of the economy. Hence, we may assume that the stock price drop may have been affected. Let's look at the table below:

| Month     | Inflation rate (%) |
|-----------|--------------------|
| June      | 4.4                |
| July      | 5.0                |
| August    | 5.5                |
| September | 5.9                |
| October   | 6.8                |
| November  | 7.8                |

Inflation has risen substantially in 2021, according to the data provided by the National Bank of Poland[^5].

## Conclusion

I think that, despite the rise of Amazon.pl, inflation, and COVID-19-related financial situation, now is the time to buy Allegro's stock. The latest recommendation I was able to find, published on November 5 by *Dom Maklerski mBanku S.A.*, recommends holding the previously bought shares (price per share back then was PLN 44.5)[^6]. Previous recommendations published between February and July 2021 by *Goldman Sachs* and *Trigon Dom Maklerski S.A.*, when the price was significantly higher; between PLN 56.5 and 73.9, recommended buying the stock[^7].

I guess that the price will rise back to at least PLN 50 in 2022, which, granted that one decides to purchase, let's say 15 shares PLN 37 each right now, will generate a decent profit:

$$
15 * 37\thinspace zł = 555\thinspace zł
\\15 * 50\thinspace zł = 750\thinspace zł \rightarrow +35\%
$$
